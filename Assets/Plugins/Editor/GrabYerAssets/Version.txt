Grab Yer Assets (GYA) - Version History:

Special acknowledgments:
- Tiaan Geldenhuys - Providing the snippet for the throttled progress bar and other tidbits that he has been kind enough to offer.

-- IMPORTANT:

When upgrading from v2 to v3, please remove the existing '../Plugins/Editor/GrabYerAssets' folder before installing v3.
If v3 is installed over v2, there is likely to be a conflict due to a left over file from v2, 'GrabYerAssets.cs'.
This file can safely be deleted as it has been replaced by 'GYA.cs'.

-- NOTES:

2.15e02a: Last version officially supported by Unity 3.x & 4.x.  Active development will focus on Unity 5.x+

-- Unity for Linux (beta) support:

- 'Persist Mode': Unity for Linux doesn't have the default 'Standard Assets' assets/folder.
- SV seems slow when viewing 'Not Downloaded' on Linux with minimal downloads and the 'Purchased Assets' list has been dl'd
  Issue may be with: VM, Linux beta, or?  Haven’t noticed this on Win/Mac.
- NullRef error in Prefs scrollview when adding a User folder (beta issue?)

-- Version Changes:

- 3.21.2.1801
- Purchased Asset List (PAL) retrieval has been disabled until a working solution can be found.
- Adjusted how 'Move To Group' functions.  'Move To Group' will ONLY move assets selected in the current group view.  This is intentional.
- If 'Packages of Type->UnGrouped' is selected and you switch to a group view, the view will automatically revert to showing All.

- 3.20.7.503
- UI changes for new features
- Added: 'Move To Group' to Group Right-Click-Menu for moving individual entries
- Fixed: 'Deselect All (Visible)', 'Auto-Deselect Master List' was overriding manual activation, clearing the entire list
- Enabling toggle 'Auto-Deselect Master List' will disable the 'Auto-Deselect Visible List' menu entry for better clarity

- 3.20.6.1703
- Added: 'Clear List After Action' toggles. This allows you to enable/disable the default action of GYA to clear the current list view after performing a related Selection/Marked action.
  'Auto-Deselect Visible List' - When enabled, it is the defualt action to clear selections from the Current/Visible list view.
  'Auto-Deselect Master List' - When enabled, it overrides 'Auto-Deselect Visible List' and forces GYA to clear selections from the Entire/Master list after the performed action.
  If both are disabled, then GYA will NOT clear any selections after performing a related action.
- Added: 'Deselect All (Master)', this will manually clear selections from the Entire/Master list immediately.
- Added: 'Move To Group', this performs the following (2) actions; it will copy the selections to a selected group and then remove them from the current group.
  Note: This will *only* process selections in the current group view.
        Do not make selections from multiple groups and attempt to Move them as this will likely fail to have the intended results.

- 3.20.4.2301
- Fixed Open Asset URL in Unity
- Fixed Asset URL in saved CSV files
- Fixed Open Publisher URL

- 3.20.4.2201
- Fixes related to the new Asset Store: Open Asset URL, Open Publisher URL, etc.
- Fixes for Group handling as reported by 'sxa'

- 3.19.2.1301
- Unity 2019 GUI quick fix
- Changed auto-update to include prompting the user to simplify at this time
- Minor changes

- 3.19.2.801
- Changed: GYA v3.19.x.x will convert the old prefs file to 'GYA Prefs v3.json'
  Please upgrade All projects that use GYA to v3.19.x.x) or newer.

- 3.19.2.702
- Fixed: 'Cat->Pkgs of Type->Damaged' list order
- Removed duplicate call as it's handled by RefreshSV

- 3.19.2.701
- Fixed: Listview not being fully updated after Rename methods called, list could become out of order 
- Changed: Prefs 'Silent Mode' to 'Hide Tooltips', console messages are no longer hidden

- 3.19.2.502
- Fixed: Assets with Untitled/Missing/Blank titles in the meta data once again show up properly in the list
  The change also allows searching on the appended version in the listview

- 3.19.2.501
- Fixed: 'Right-click->Copy/Move to Sorted' was returning null path
- Changed: '.. to Sorted' to clean the 'category.label' so that it maintains Unity's pathing structure
  Example: 'Textures MaterialsIcons UI' instead of 'Textures & Materials/Icons & UI'
- Fixed: When removing multiple entries from a Group, it could slow down due to extra processing between each entry

- 3.19.2.301
- Added: 'Auto-Update' feature to GYA.  If a new version is downloaded from the Asset Store, GYA will detect it during a Refresh.
  Update Options: 1) Disable updating, 2) automatically update or 3) prompt to update (Default)
- Version rename fix, packages marked as isDamaged (blank/untitled titles, etc) will no longer be processed.
  This was done to prevent a few issues as it cannot be safely applied to a damaged title.
- Fixed pkg versions having a '/' , such as '5.0/20'

- 3.19.2.201
- Testing [JsonExtensionData] as a solution to changing preferences structure

- 3.19.1.2801
- Added: User selectable version info for 'Version Renaming', 'Preferences->Renaming'
- Fixed: Possible loss of wordwrap due to recent changes and also increased the height of the info foldout

- 3.19.1.2602
- Added: 'Right-click->File Options->Rename without Version' to remove the Version info from a single asset.

- WARNING: While 'Overwrite Protection' & 'Remove Versions' should be perfectly safe to use,
  it is highly recommended to have a backup of your Asset Store folder just to be safe.
  This is always a good idea in any case.

- Updated: Copy/move/rename versioning and related methods
- Added: 'Categories->Packages of Type->Missing Files (Groups)'.  Lists any files that are part of a Group, but are physically missing.
- Added: Option to remove the Version info from the filenames.  This in essence reverses the 'Overwrite Protection'
  Note: If there is more than (1) version of an asset within the Asset Store folder, there is a potential for a filename conflict.
  If this is the case, only the first file will be renamed without the version.
- Added: Option to force rebuild the AS folder data under 'Prefs->Maintenance'

- 3.19.1.2202
- Changed: Minor change to the AS folder scan to prevent scanning of the Unity/cache folder

- 3.19.1.2201
- Added assets version_id to filename when renaming with version.  Example: "Grab Yer Assets v3.18.11.3001 (5.0.0f4) (405747).unitypackage"
  This allows for better handling of assets that have been updated but have NOT had the version changed.
  This may be the case when a publisher only makes a minor change that does not warrant a version change.

- 3.19.1.2001
- Added: 'Asset Overwrite Protection', enabling this auto-renames ALL official Asset Store packages in the AS folder with the version info.
  This will prevent updates, downloading new versions from the Asset Store, from overwriting existing files.
  NOTE 1: This may take a few minutes depending upon the number of assets in the AS folder.
  NOTE 2: (Fixed in 3.19.1.2201) This will work with one exception.  If an update is a minor update and the publisher does not change the
  version number, there may be a conflict.
- Fixed: The '# of Visible Assets' toggle to toggle back to All assets when clicked if there are zero selected assets.
  
- 3.19.1.1801
- Changed: 'Selected Assets->Clear' to 'Selected Assets->Deselect All' for better clarification
- Changed: The '# of Visible Assets' count, 1st tab on the 3rd row, is now a toggle for 'Show All/Show All Selected'
  Toggle will only activate IF there are selected assets
- Fixed: Bug from 'Sorted Assets' forcing 'Rename with Version' to always sort the asset
- Added: Notifies the user when refreshing if a filename has invalid path characters in it.
  While the character may be valid on the current OS, it may not be on another and is left to the user to correct.
  I have only recently run across a single official package with this that is apparently fairly old being dated 2011.
- Added: Improved handling of invalid path characters in the title when it is used to rename the file with version.

- 3.19.1.1501
- Added: Copy/Move to 'Sorted Assets' folder, accessed from 'Selected Assets->File Options' and 'Right-Click->File Options'
  'Sorted Assets' folder can be assigned under 'Preferences->User Folders' with an option to 'Always Ask for Folder'
- Added: 'Selected Assets->Select All Older Versions'
- Added: 'Selected Assets->Export List as CSV', this is a simpler list than the one under 'Preferences->Maintenance'

- 3.19.1.1301

- 3.18.11.3001 -- Submitted Version
- If GYA detects a unitypackage that has a generic title of 'Untitled' in the JSON header, it will use the filename of the asset as the title.
This was added as I have noticed more then a few packages with an 'Untitled' title.

Sub-groups do not have to be in order.  Making a Top-level group is not required for it to work.  So do not make 'Sub' or 'Sub/' as a seperate group.
Example:
Group01
Top/SubA
Group02
Top/SubB

- Fix for Unity 2018

- Fix for possible 'Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure'

- 3.17.6.1205
- Changed: Modified popup menu handling.

- 3.17.6.905
- Added: Sort drop-down options; "by Date (Created)*" & "by Date (Updated)*", accessible if PAL data is available.
  Information contained in the PAL does not cover different versions of the same Asset ID, all versions of the same ID
  will be listed in order, please keep this in mind.

- 3.17.6.902
- Disabled: 'Consolidate' (Move Old Assets) features.  Assets within the Old Assets folder will still show up
  in the list so that they can be moved/deleted as always.  This is primarily to prevent any issues with inadvertantly
  moving old assets that shouldn't be moved considering the recent changes.
- Changed: Restored 'Packages Built with' & 'Packages of Type' sub-menus under 'Categories' for better organization.

- 3.17.6.901

  If you decide to use under Unity 4.x, let me know if you have any issues.

- 3.17.6.601
- Update: Modified sessionID retrieval

- 3.17.6.405
- Fixed: Web calls using WWW were no longer reliable and may have experienced possible 'HTTP Error 500 Internal server error'
- Update: Web calls re-written to utilize HttpWebRequest instead of WWW
- Update: Code cleanup and optimization

NOTE: 
GYA versions prior to 3.17.5.2302 will NOT be compatible in reading the updated PAL structure.
Outdated versions of GYA will likely be in an error state and will require an update to the latest version.

With 'Persist Mode' enabled, you can easily do this via the menu: "Assets -> Import Package -> Grab Yer Assets".
This will import the latest downloaded version of GYA that 'Persist Mode' has copied to your Standard Assets folder.

- 3.17.5.2607
- Update: UI adjustments for using Zios Themes
- Update: Adjustment for PAL handling in Windows/Linux

- 3.17.5.2306

- Updated: Handling for the updated layout/structure/data of the PAL
- Fixed: If GYA detects that the PAL has an outdated structure, it will delete the file.  The current version will be downloaded upon the next Refresh.

- 3.17.4.1001

- 3.17.4.401
- Fixed: 'Categories-Packages:' selections not always auto-enabling 'All Assets' tab
- Fixed: Unity 5.6x multi-import reporting an error on Sync import even thou packages were imported.  Multi-import Override will force Async for Unity 5.6x+

- 3.17.2.1503
- 3rd Party Asset Support (Package2Folder).  'Import To Folder' option added when Right-Clicking an Asset in the list.  If Package2Folder exists but is not installed, there will be an option to install, if not there will be a link to download from the Asset Store.

- 3.16.12.1001
- Fixed: Version handling for extended Unity version strings such as "Unity5.4.2f2-GVR13" for the Google Daydream VR version, "-GVR13" causes a parse error.

- 3.16.10.2301

- Fixed: 3rd toolbar wasn't hiding tooltips in 'Silent Mode'

- 3.16.9.3003
- Added: Category, 'Not In Purchased List'.  Requires the 'Purchased Assets' list. These are packages that are either:
  1) No longer available on the Asset Store, OR..
  2) Available in the Asset Store, ..but.. the package *is not* in your Purchased List.  Ahem...
- Made ‘Show All Selected’ toggle
- Fixed the ‘Copy to Clipboard’ URL.

- 3.16.9.2903
- Added more 'Copy To Clipboard' & 'Open URL' options

- 3.16.9.2901
- Reworked Categories handling
- Added 'Show All Selected' to the 'Selected Assets' dropdown
- Removed 'Export as CSV' from 'Selected Assets' dropdown, it is located where it should be in Prefs-Maint

- 3.16.9.2804
- Fixed: Warning in Unity 5.5.0b3 beta

- 3.16.9.2802

- Minor adjustments/additions to the Preferences window

- 3.16.9.2705
- Fixed: 'Package Info' foldout not remembering its state

- 3.16.9.2704
- Disabled showing 'Versions:' when Right-Clicking in the list, to prevent possible confusion with 'Version Locking'
- Adjust Pref Window to immediately show changes that affect the GUI when toggled
- Disabled 'Persist Mode' in Linux for the time being

- 3.16.9.2703

- Fixed: 'Purchased Assets' Download fails.  Info is now provided to the user, if required, on what needs to be done
- Info: In Linux, GYA appears to perform as expected with some minor visual glitches, most likely due to 'Unity for Linux's current beta state.  But I will keep an eye on things.

- 3.16.9.2603
- Fixed: (Linux) Opening of folders & URLs

- 3.16.9.2602

- Fixed: Possibe CultureInfo/DateTime issue when downloading 'AS Purchased.json'
- Added: Additional error check and json formatting when downloading 'AS Purchased.json'

- 3.16.9.2001
- Fixed: Possible Null-Ref when exporting CSV

- 3.16.9.1905
- Added: Sort by 'Purchased' Date as long as the Purchased Assets list (AS Purchased.json) has been downloaded.
  NOTE: Many assets may contain NULL as the Purchased Date, these will obviously show last in the list.
- Fixed: Issue with sorting by Publish Date that cropped up due to a recent change.

- 3.16.9.1904
- Added: 'Version Locking' of 'Asset Store' Assets within a Group.  A lock symbol will be visible IF the asset is version locked.
  'Right-Clicking' a User asset within a Group will now show 'Lock Version for this Group', this allows you to select either 'Newest' or from a list of available versions to lock to the current Group.  Newest is the default and will ALWAYS use the most up-to-date available/downloaded version.
  'Exported' assets do not require version locking as they do not contain any version data.
  NOTE: 'Version Locks' can ONLY be placed upon assets located within a 'User Folder'!  This is simply to prevent a lock from becoming invalid when a newer version is downloaded at some point in the future, which would most likely overwrite the existing file in the AS Folder.  So, if you need to lock the latest version, copy it to a 'User Folder', then enable the 'Version Lock' for it.

- 3.16.9.1505
- Further UI tweaks, code seperation and cleanup, etc.

- 3.16.8.3101

- Fixed: Scrollview issue with 5.0/5.1/5.2

- 3.16.8.2702
- Changed: 3rd Toolbar, replaced Text with Icons
- Tooltips added for all three control bars

- 3.16.8.2301
- Fixed: Group #'s in list where incremented by 1
- Fixed: Group was showing the older version of an asset instead of the newest
- Changed: Auto-consolidate has been disabled
- Added: Right-Click on 'Refresh' button will force a check to download your 'Purchased Assets List'

- 3.16.8.2203
- Change: Replace CM code
- Fixed: Project Assets not in correct order in list
- Added: Categories Menu has a new option: 'Not Downloaded' (Show assets not yet downloaded, requires Purchased Asset List downloading to be enabled). 
- Pinned Icons adjustment
- Added: Right-click on 'Not Downloaded' Assets has the option to 'Download'.  This will open the Asset URL inside of Unity from which the Asset can then be downloaded.  If a way can be found to directly download an Asset, I will implement it, until then, this at least offers an option. NOTE: While this is provided as an option, I still recommend using Unity's Download's page for updating/downloading. 

- 3.16.8.1405
- Updated: Scrollview code re-written, can handle large list without slowing down, tested with 10k+ assets.
- Added: Clicking on the 'Main Menu->GYA v3.16.xx.xxxx' will open a window that will show the additional info available from your Purchased Assets list as you scroll over the list.
- Icon links for assets added to CSV exports

- 3.16.8.1109
- Updated: Removed any un-needed logic handling within OnGUI to further improve performance
- Added: Optional 3rd Toolbar for quicker access to the main collections, while the first field shows how many assets are currently displayed in the list.
- Added: An icon 'Curved Right arrow' to highlight assets that are older versions
- Fixed: Multiple asset versions in the view now make sure they are listed under the newest version of the asset even if sorting by title would normally force it to be listed elsewhere
- Added: Deprecated assets are now detected 
- Added: Categories Menu has a new option: 'Deprecated' (Show assets no longer supported, requires Purchased Asset List downloading to be enabled)
- Added: Categories Menu has a new option: 'Multiple Versions' (Shows all assets that have more then one version)
- Fixed: Groups now detect if an asset is missing and will display '[MISSING]' in the list
- GYA Refresh console message now provides 'Scan Results Per Collection' which can be seen by scrolling the console entry down
- 'GYA Data Folder' menu option has been added for easy access to GYA's files should it ever be needed.
- Many other internal changes

- 3.16.6.102
- Revert: 6.71 while faster for scanning, the filesToSkip portion may not have caught all changes on creationDate.  That portion of the code has been changed to a prior revision.  While slightly slower, it's only really noticable after the unityPackage count reaches a few thousand.  I'll work on optimizing that later.
- Added: 2 options to the Prefs for gathering additional data from Unity, 1 local and 1 from Unity's website.  The functions currently gather the data and store it in the following files. (Local = AS Packages.json) (Online = AS Purchased.json)
 They acquire roughly the same data that GYA does from packages with the inclusion of the package's icon for the local version and purchase details for the online version.
 The online version acquires your purchased unityPackages list directly from Unity.  Requires that you be signed into Unity and there is no error handling for the login check yet.

- 3.16.6.71
- Found an Issue: After running v3, v2 MAY fail to process the 'GYA Assets.json'.
  Solution - I've renamed the v3 file to 'GYA Assets v3.json', this will prevent the different versions from re-creating the file in it's own format.  This was the simplest solution to prevent old versions from conflicting.
  
- Fixed: Click being consumed after right clicking from a drop-down
- Fixed: Deleting a file, would update the list, but could re-appear as a phantom list entry, list wasn't being re-saved

-- Version change from v2 to v3 --

2.16d13a
- Change: The way ImportPackageImmediately is called due to a change in 5.4.0b14. It is recommended to upgrade GYA prior to upgrading to b14.

2.16d09a
- Added: Preference 'Settings->Multi-Import Override' for user control of the Multi-import method used.  ‘Default’ will auto-choose the best option.  GYA may override the selected option if it is not available for the currently running version of Unity.

2.16c25a
- Fixed: Multi-import for Unity 5.3+

2.15j28c
- Fixed: Unity 5.3b - Possible NullException error
- Update: 'Ungrouped Assets' supports Exported packages
- Misc code cleanup

2.15j16a
- Added: CSV export now also exports package URLs. Tested with Google Sheets and Libre Office.  NOTE: Links may not work for some spreadsheet apps, Numbers/Excel, as they may encode the '#' sign that is used by Unity for the package URL as %23 when clicked.
- Added: 'Export Group Data as CSV' under the Multi-Asset Menu
- Changed: CSV export fields id, version_id, category_id & publisher_id return an EMPTY field instead of '0' for Exported/'Non-Asset Store' packages
- Fixed: Unity 5.3b - warning CS0618: `UnityEngine.TextEditor.content' is obsolete: `Please use 'text' instead of 'content''

- 'Export as CSV' now includes the unity_version.

2.15c18c
- Added: ‘Menu->Maintenance->Clean up Outdated GYA Support Files’ to remove ANY outdated GYA related files including the ‘-Grab Yer Assets (Old)’ folder.
- Reorganized the Maintenance Menu
- Updated the GYA upgrade handling

Note:
After upgrading any/all projects that contain GYA you can run (2) menu items to finalize the upgrade:
1- Menu->Maintenance->Merge Old Assets from Old GYA Versions
2- Menu->Maintenance->Clean up Outdated GYA Support Files
Doing this will ensure that your Old Asset files have been moved if required AND clean up any remaining GYA related files.

This is NOT required for a typical Unity setup and is only provided to assist when a SymLink’d Asset Store folder has been detected or GYA has reported an error when moving the Old Assets folder.

2.15c16b
- Added: ‘Open URL of Selected Packages’ to multi drop-down, invalid assets will be ignored
- Updated: Improved error checks relating to symlinks.

2.15c15j
- Placed GYA’s supporting files/folder into it’s own folder:
'../Unity/Grab Yer Assets/Asset Store-Old’
'../Unity/Grab Yer Assets/GYA Settings.json'
'../Unity/Grab Yer Assets/GYA Assets.json'
- Added: ‘Menu->Maintenance’ sub-menu added, related maintenance functions have been moved under it.
- Added: ‘Menu->Maintenance->Merge Old Assets from Old GYA Versions’ will move Old Assets from the prior version of GYA to the new Old Asset folder if needed.  If you’re not using SymLinks for the Asset Store(s)/Old Assets folder, they will be moved to the new folder automatically.  Otherwise, you can run this routine manually to merge the Old Assets into the new folder when you are ready.
- Changed: Refresh Progress Bar default TRUE
- Improved SymLink handling

2.15c12c
- Added: ‘Remove from Current Group’ for removing Multiple Assets from a Group at one time
- Added: ‘Asset Store Packages’ to the Categories drop-down

2.15c11b
- Fixed: Multiple Invert was functioning on the entire list when in a collection/group
- Changed: Optimized and cleaned up a bit of code

2.15c10g
- Fixed: GYA now detects if the Asset Store folder is a SymLink/Junction and will NOT attempt to move it’s data files, if required, if one is detected.  Useful information will be shown in the GYA window.
- Added: Error checks around menu items for when GYA detects an error.  Prevents possibly trying to access data that would not be there in a controlled error state.

2.15c08a
- Added: Two (2) Progress Bar toggles
 “Menu->Settings->Show during Refresh”, default = DISABLED
 “Menu->Settings->Show during File Actions”, default = ENABLED
- Changed: ”Menu->Settings->Show All Asset Store Folders" to default = ENABLED

2.15c06j -- Submitted
- Changed: Moved the new Packages & Folder entries to the top of the Categories section, to better portray their intent.  They are now labeled as “Show Actual Contained In:”.  These 4 entries will show what is ACTUALLY there regardless of the “Settings->Show All Asset Store Folders” so that there is always a quick way to get to these files even if you normally prefer to hide them from the current version of Unity that is running.

2.15c06h
- Added: Under the Search bar drop-down, “Sort->by Package ID”

2.15c06g
- Added: Settings option “Open URLs In Unity”, ENABLED by default

 1- ENABLED = Scan both the "Asset Store" and "Asset Store-5.x" folders.
 2- DISABLED = Scan "Asset Store" if running Unity 3/4 ..OR.. Scan "Asset Store-5.x" if running Unity 5, automatically determined at run-time.
- Added: ”Menu->Settings->Show All Asset Store Folders", default is DISABLED.
 1- DISABLED = Show "Asset Store" if running Unity 3/4 ..OR.. Show "Asset Store-5.x" if running Unity 5, automatically determined at run-time.
 2- ENABLED = Show both the "Asset Store" and "Asset Store-5.x" folders.

2.15c06a
- NOT-ENABLED: ‘scannedFolders’ tag to the json file to note the last scanned AS folder and if it matches GYA’s settings for the current Unity version.  This is to auto refresh data when switching between Unity versions.  Disabled this in lieu of the changes made in 2.15c06f

2.15c05f
- Added: Right-click drop-down “Copy Path To Clipboard” for selected asset or by clicking on one of the asset versions listed below for it’s path
- Added: Main menu, there is now a ‘*’ after the currently active Asset Store folder just as a quick visual reference.
- Fixed: ‘Persist Mode’ will now only copy a newer version of itself if the package.unity_version is <= Application Unity version.  This will prevent a Unity 5 version from being copied into the Unity 4 Standard Assets for example.

2.15c05d
- Fixed: A possible Windows error when moving the User file.
- Fixed: A possible permissions error when attempting to move the Old Assets folder.
- Added: ”Menu->Settings->Scan All Asset Store Folders", default is DISABLED.

  1- “To Unity 5 Asset Store-5.x”, will move ANY assets located in the OLD  “Asset Store” folder over to the NEW “Asset Store-5.x” folder.  Duplicates between the (2) folders will be left untouched at this time.
  2- “To Unity 4 Asset Store”, will move ANY assets located in the NEW “Asset Store-5.x” folder over to the OLD “Asset Store” folder, EXCEPT Unity 5 specific assets.  Duplicates between the (2) folders will be left untouched at this time.
  3- “Delete Empty Sub Folders”, will scan BOTH Asset Store folders and remove any empty sub-folders & delete any “.DS_Store” files if it is the only file within the folder.
- Added: Unity 4 specific Categories:
  1- “Packages: Unity 4” = Packages that are tagged as being Unity 4 or older as per the “unity_version” tag AND any packages that do NOT have the “unity_version” tag.

2.15b17b
- Moved: GYA Data Files have been moved for better handling with Unity 5,
  Old location: “../Unity/Asset Store/”
  New location: “../Unity/”
  What was moved: “Grab Yer Assets.json”, “Grab Yer Assets User.json” and the “-Grab Yer Assets (Old)” folder

2.15b17a
- Fixed: Asset color in the list may have been incorrect when handling duplicate and/or old versions between the “Asset Store” & “Asset Store-5.x” folders

2.15a29a -- Submitted

- Changed: Deleting an individual asset will no longer reset marked assets
- Fixed: Issue with null being returned if the ‘Asset Store’ folder is empty

2.15a01e -- Submitted
- Fixed: Auto Consolidate is functioning as expected.

2.15a01c -- Submitted
- Added: Unity 5 handling as follows:
- IMPORTANT - While standard assets folder is optional when installing Unity 5, this is required for GYA's 'Persist Mode' to work.  Without the folder, GYA will NOT be able to update itself, nor will it show up under 'Assets->Import Package'!
- If running under versions OLDER than Unity 5, GYA will look for and use the 'Standard Packages' folder.
- If running under Unity 5 or NEWER, GYA will look for and use the 'Sample Assets' folder.
- References to 'Standard' regarding the 'Standard Packages' folder have changed to reflect the difference between Unity 5 and older versions.  GYA will now show 'Standard Packages' for versions older then Unity 5 and 'Sample Assets' for Unity 5 and newer as appropriate throughout the UI.
- GYA will now dynamically rescan the Standard Packages/Sample Assets folder when loading the existing JSON file.  This is to ensure that the proper folder is displayed in the UI even when changing back and forth between versions of Unity.
- Update: Refreshing in Offline Mode will now reload the current Offline version of the JSON file.

2.14k26a -- Submitted
- Updated: Fast Asset Store URL

2.14j15a -- Submitted
- Changed: How GYA handles multiple copies of the same asset with the same version in the AS folder.  While this should never occur unless files are manually duplicated outside of GYA, it now prevents both copies from showing as Old versions.

2.14j13a
- Fixed: When right-clicking on an asset, titles of old versions that had a '/' in it would create sub-menus.

2.14j10c -- Submitted
- Added: 'Damaged Packages' under the Categories drop-down.  To refresh, a damaged package typically just has a detectable problem in the embedded JSON header and generally does not cause a problem when importing.

2.14j09b
- Changed: If asset version is detected in the asset title, the version will not be appended when shown in the list.

2.14j08a
- Added: An optional URL for checking asset details: the 'Fast Asset Store'
1) Via the main menu, will show the Daily-Deal.
2) Via right-clicking an asset, will show the asset related info without the extra overhead of the full Unity Asset Store.

- Added: Any asset files that are detected as being damaged will now show an error icon on the right side of the list.
- Changed: Official Asset Store assets that have a MISSING or BLANK 'title' will by default use the filename in place of the title.  If other versions of the same asset exist, it will use that title if possible.

2.14i13b -- Submitted
- HotFix: For handling a BLANK 'title' in the embedded JSON of an Asset Store package.  Asset Store packages with missing title's will show up in the list as '0 BAD FILE (pkgFilename) pkgVersion'.  I will work on a more elegant solution for the next update.

2.14i11a
- Added: 'Load Alternate GYA Data File' allows for loading a GYA data file from another machine for use in offline mode
- Added: 'Offline Mode' Prevents the data from being automatically overwritten when starting GYA or pressing the Refresh button.  Disable to return to normal functionality.

Note:
Offline Mode is primarily meant for testing or reference.
Refreshing is disabled when in Offline Mode.
As expected, asset related file operations will fail if the actual files are not accessible to the machine running in offline mode.

2.14i06c -- Submitted
- Added: 'Export as CSV' to export a complete list of assets

2.14i02c
